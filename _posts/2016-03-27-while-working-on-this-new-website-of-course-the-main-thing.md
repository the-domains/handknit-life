While working on this new website of course, the main thing on my mind was content. It didn't matter how good the site looked if I had nothing to talk about.

One of my first thoughts was to notice that not all 'yarn people' are the same. We each have different levels of how much this hobby of our takes up in time, space and dollars! 

I'm surrounded by yarn, and 'think' yarn just about all the time. I do knit and/or spin almost every day. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f16ecd5d-1639-45de-b88c-e55d20c2d029.jpg)

What I've realized is that it doesn't matter how much you stash, how much you knit, finish and start... if you are happy, and all this yarn stuff makes you happy. You are definitely in!
