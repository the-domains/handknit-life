  I’m fascinated, yet confounded by how often I see news about color.  This
  seasons colors….. Pantone’s colors… home decor… fashion….



  It got me thinking… do I care what is the ‘color of the year’…



  I suppose in some ways it gives me inspiration! When I do think about how many
  different colors we are able to see, I chuckle when I hear myself saying ‘oh,
  I’ve never seen that before’.  I’m absolutely delighted when I create a new dye
  color!!  Steel Teal, was one of those colors.



  I think as far as my fashion goes, the popular colors of the season have zero
  effect on my wardrobe.



  Now comes yarn – so many colors, so little time!  Between the fibre content and
  the color, my pocketbook loses every time.  However, I can say with certainty,
  whatever color I’m knitting with at this moment, hasn’t been impacted by this
  season at all !!
